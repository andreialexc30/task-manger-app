<h1>About the project</h1>
This is the source code for a task manager app that was built while following Andrew Mead's <em>The Complete NodeJS Developer Course(3rd edition)</em>.
<h2>Description</h2>
The Task Manager application allows users to sign up and create a profile with their prefered email address and password. Each user can then create different tasks in a to-do type of fashion. The tasks are restricted to each user's separate profile and cannot be seen by other users.
<h2>Information</h2>
This application has been created with the help of JavaScript and NodeJS for back-end coding along with MongoDB for storing user and task data. Postman was used for https requests.
<h2>What I've learned</h2>
Andrew Mead's course was a pretty long one and I felt lost in some places but overall I've learned more than I could have possibly wanted. Starting with NodeJS and it's tools like Express, nodemon, validator, sharp, etc; it helped me understand how the back-end of web pages and web based applications works. I have also experimented with databases for the first time and how data gets stored. I've also used basic NodeJS testing to make sure the app works flawlessly.
